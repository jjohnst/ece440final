ECE 440 Final Project - Rollcall

*Must have MySQL install on machine.

How to compile:
  1. Download all the files and put them in one location. 
  2. In a terminal, change directory to where you saved the files.
  3. Type "make" without the quotes. This will compile the rollcall and submit files. This should work if you're on a Mac. Some configuration of the libraries to include may be needed. They are declared at the top of the makefile.
  
How to run:
./rollcall requires sudo privileges and takes a command line argument. Typying ./rollcall -h will display the different options. A sample command to run rollcall is "sudo ./rollcall -f". To run the submit program, simply type ./submit.

The file might need to be configured depending on the database. The variables to configure are in the header file.
